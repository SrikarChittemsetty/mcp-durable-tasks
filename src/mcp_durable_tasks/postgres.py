"""Postgres-backed TaskStore — the durable implementation.

This is the whole point of the project: the same TaskStore contract as the
in-memory backend, but state lives in Postgres, so it survives a process crash.

Two decisions carry the design, and both are deliberately pushed down into the
database rather than done in Python, because Python-level checks race under
concurrency and don't survive a crash mid-check:

  1. Idempotent create -> INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING.
     The UNIQUE index is the source of truth. Even if two requests with the same
     key arrive simultaneously, exactly one row is created; the other request
     falls through to a SELECT and gets the winner. No check-then-insert race.

  2. Safe update -> SELECT ... FOR UPDATE inside a transaction. The row is locked
     for the duration of the read-modify-write, so two concurrent updaters can't
     both read the old state and stomp each other. If the state-machine check
     rejects the transition, the transaction rolls back and nothing persists.

        rolls back both — the task stays WORKING and a retry re-runs cleanly. A
