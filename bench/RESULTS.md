# Benchmark results

**What this measures:** per-operation latency (percentiles) and throughput for
the core store operations, comparing the in-memory reference backend against the
durable Postgres backend. The gap between them is the cost of durability — the
price paid, per operation, to survive a crash.

**How to reproduce:**

```bash
python bench/benchmark.py --conninfo "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=postgres dbname=mdt" \
    --iterations 2000 --warmup 200
```

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | Apple Silicon (arm64), macOS |
| Python | 3.12 |
| Postgres | 16 (local, single connection, TCP to 127.0.0.1) |
| Iterations | 2000 measured, 200 warmup (discarded) |
| Clock | `time.perf_counter` (monotonic, high-resolution) |

Single process, single connection. This is the store's own overhead, not a
distributed deployment.

## Reading the numbers

- **Durability costs ~30–50× in latency and ~1–2 orders of magnitude in
  throughput.** In-memory `create` runs at ~257k ops/s; durable `create` at
  ~7k ops/s. That is the fsync-and-network tax for state that survives a crash.
- **`update` is the most expensive durable op** (~0.16ms p50, ~0.75ms p99),
  which is expected: it's a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (row lock) followed by an
  `UPDATE`, two statements plus a commit, versus `create`'s single insert.
- **Tail vs. median:** durable p99 is ~4–5× the p50. The tail is dominated by
  commit-time I/O — the reason percentiles, not averages, are the honest way to
  report a durable system's latency.

## Comparative correctness under concurrency

The latency numbers above measure *this system against itself* (durable vs.
in-memory floor). This section measures it against the **alternative most people
reach for first**: application-level "check if the key exists, then insert"
dedup, with no database constraint.

Both strategies face the identical workload — N simultaneous requests carrying
the same idempotency key (a retry storm / at-least-once delivery). The only
variable is the dedup mechanism. Correct behaviour = exactly one row created.

**Reproduce:**

```bash
python bench/correctness.py --conninfo "host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 user=postgres dbname=mdt" \
    --trials 200 --work-ms 2 --concurrency-levels "2,4,8,16"
```

**Result** (200 trials per level, requests released simultaneously — the retry-storm worst case):

| concurrent requests | naive: trials double-charged | naive: avg duplicate charges/trial | ours: double-charges |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2  | 200/200 (100%) | 1.00  | 0/200 |
| 4  | 200/200 (100%) | 3.00  | 0/200 |
| 8  | 200/200 (100%) | 7.00  | 0/200 |
| 16 | 200/200 (100%) | 14.99 | 0/200 |

**Reading it:** the naive approach's duplicate charges scale as ≈ **N − 1** — under
simultaneous arrival, all N requests pass the existence check before any of them
inserts, so every one creates a charge. `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` against a UNIQUE
index is **exactly-once at every concurrency level**. This is the whole thesis,
measured: pushing the guarantee into the database is not a stylistic choice, it's
the difference between 0 and N−1 double-charges under contention.

(Simultaneous release is the worst case; it's also a realistic one — retry storms
and at-least-once queues deliver duplicates in tight bursts. The point is that the
naive approach has no safe floor under contention, while the DB-level approach has
no failures at all.)

## Roadmap

The intended next comparison is a **Temporal-wrapped baseline** running the same
task lifecycle, to answer "doesn't Temporal already do this?" with a measured
latency/throughput delta rather than an assertion. Note the honest framing: the
goal there is *comparable latency at a fraction of the operational footprint* for
this specific workload — not "faster than Temporal," which would be an
apples-to-oranges claim against a full distributed engine.
