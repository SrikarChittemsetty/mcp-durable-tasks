"""Crash-recovery / exactly-once tests — the centerpiece.

Each test spawns the worker as a REAL separate OS process, kills it with an
actual SIGKILL at a precise point relative to the commit, and then proves the
side effect (a ledger row) landed exactly once across the crash + recovery.

This is the property the whole project claims. If these pass, the claim is real;
if they can't be made to pass, the claim is a bluff. They only run when a
Postgres URL is configured.
