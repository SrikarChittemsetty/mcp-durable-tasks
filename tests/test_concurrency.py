"""Concurrency test — two workers race the same task, still exactly once.

Crash recovery proves durability across *time* (a process dies, another picks
up). This proves correctness across *space*: two workers running at the SAME
instant on the SAME task must not both apply the side effect. The `SELECT ...
FOR UPDATE` row lock plus the terminal-state check are what serialize them.

Note the subtle, honest outcome: BOTH workers exit successfully and both think
they finished — but only one actually charged. The lock made the loser's
`complete_with_effect` a no-op. The ledger, not the exit codes, is the source
of truth, and it holds exactly one row.
